# Dialogflow CX Competition
Google Cloud recently released Dialogflow CX, a bot building platform for building chatbots and telephony agents. It empowers your team to accelerate creating enterprise-level conversational experiences through a visual bot builder and an advanced NLU. It provides a new way of designing agents, taking a state machine approach to agent design. This gives you clear and explicit control over a conversation, a better end-user experience, and a better development workflow.
