# Dialogflow CX Competition
Google Cloud recently released Dialogflow CX, a bot building platform for building chatbots and telephony agents. It empowers your team to accelerate creating enterprise-level conversational experiences through a visual bot builder and an advanced NLU. It provides a new way of designing agents, taking a state machine approach to agent design. This gives you clear and explicit control over a conversation, a better end-user experience, and a better development workflow.

To use the template:
1. Upload the file exported_agent_Cottbi.blob to your computer
2. Creat Agent in Dialigflow CX
3. Restore uploaded file to your created agent
